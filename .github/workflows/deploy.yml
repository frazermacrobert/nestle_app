To get this right, I have corrected the node-version typo and removed the cache: 'npm' requirement. Removing the cache is the safest move right now because you are likely working directly in the GitHub web editor, which means a package-lock.json might not have been generated yet. Without that lock file, the "cache" step fails and stops the whole build.

Here is the corrected, "battle-hardened" version of your .github/workflows/deploy.yml:

YAML

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          # Cache removed to prevent errors if package-lock.json is missing

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
